# NetScanner

## Objective

The primary objective of this Python script is to provide network administrators and cybersecurity professionals with a tool to identify active hosts and open ports within a specified IP range. This tool can be beneficial for network monitoring, troubleshooting, and security assessments, allowing users to ensure all expected services are available and detect any potential security vulnerabilities.

### Skills Learned

- **Python Programming:** Enhanced proficiency in Python, focusing on network interactions and automation.
- **Networking Fundamentals:** Gained a deeper understanding of IP addressing, TCP/UDP protocols, and port scanning techniques.
- **Network Scanning:** Learned techniques for efficiently scanning a range of IP addresses, identifying active hosts, and detecting open ports.
- **Scapy Library:** Practiced using the Scapy library for crafting and sending packets, as well as analyzing responses.
- **Problem Solving:** Applied logical reasoning to handle edge cases, such as non-responsive IPs and filtering open ports.

### Tools Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used to develop the network scanning tool.
- **Scapy:** A powerful Python library used for packet manipulation and network scanning.
- **Linux/Unix Environment:** The script is designed to be executed in a Linux or Unix-based operating system.
